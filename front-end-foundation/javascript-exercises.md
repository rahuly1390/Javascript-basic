# Exercises

Create a subfolder named Functions. These exercises should be placed there.

## EXERCISE 1

Write a script named simple_functions.js. In it, define three functions:

1. The first should be named favoriteThings(). In it, use a console.log() statement to display 3 lines listing your name, your favorite movie, and your favorite musician/band.
1. The second should be named whyImHere(). In it, display a sentence that describes why you joined this "Learning to Code" program.
1. The last should be named favoritePlace(). In it, display a sentence that describes one of your favorite places to visit and why.
   Below where you coded the three functions, call each of your functions.

DON'T FORGET to commit and push your repo.

## EXERCISE 2

Continue working in the Functions folder.

Write a script named more_functions.js. In it, define three functions:

1. The first should be named displayMailingLabel(). It will accept five parameters: name, address, city, state and zip. In it, use console.log() to format and display the data like you would on an address label.
2. The second should be named addNumbers(). It will accept two parameters: num1 and num2. Add the parameters together and display the result using the following format:

someNumber + someNumber = someNumber 3. The last should be named displayReceipt(). It will accept two parameters: totalDue and amountPaid. Compute and display the change due using the following format:

Total Due: $someNumber
Amount Paid: $someNumber

Change Due: $someNumber

If the amount paid is less than the total due, display a message indicating how much more needs to be paid.

Now that you've defined your functions:

- call displayMailingLabel() twice with data for two different people
- call addNumbers() twice with different numbers
- call displayReceipt() three times. In one call, you should overpay the bill, in another you should pay the bill exactly, and in the last, you should underpay the bill.

DON'T FORGET to commit and push your repo.

## Exercise 3

### Objects

1. Create an object with at least 5 properties that represents a **truck** and assign it to a variable.
2. Create a function called `displayTruck` that takes a truck object as a parameter and displays only3 of the properties on separate lines with a label for each.

```
TruckId: fsk
Size: 40x34ft
Type: Flatbed
```
